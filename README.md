# PhotoBombFix
Our project aims to provide a practical solution for removing unwanted photo bombers from photos using computer vision techniques.
In the first step, we used and fine tune two powerful open source algorithms: Mask R-CNN and LaMa.
In the second step, we integrated these algorithms into a usable app.
